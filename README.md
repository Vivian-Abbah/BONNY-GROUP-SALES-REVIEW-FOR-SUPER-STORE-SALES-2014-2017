METHODOLOGICAL NOTES
Data Source and Initial Inspection: The data source is a sales transaction dataset, likely exported from Bonny Group’s database system, as evidenced by the "Row ID," "Order ID," and other transactional columns. Initial inspection revealed the following columns: 
o	Order ID
o	Order Date
o	Ship Date
o	Delivery Mode
o	Customer ID
o	Customer Name
o	Segment
o	City
o	State
o	Postal Code
o	Region
o	Product Category
DATA CLEANING STEPS
Duplicate Removal: The dataset was checked for duplicate rows based on the Order ID and Row ID columns. Any identical rows were removed to ensure data accuracy. For example, rows 1 and 2, 28 and 29 are the same order.
Data Type Consistency: Order Date and Ship Date columns were verified to be in a consistent date format. Postal Code was checked to ensure it was treated as a text field, preventing loss of leading zeros (common in some postal codes).
Text Standardization: Customer Name, City, State, and Product Category columns were examined for inconsistencies in spelling or capitalization. Any variations were standardized to ensure consistent categorization. For example, "Los Angeles" was checked to make sure that it was always spelled the same way.
Whitespace Removal: Leading and trailing whitespace characters were removed from all text fields to prevent issues with data matching or filtering.
HANDLING MISSING VALUES
Missing Date Values: The Ship Date column was checked for missing values. If any were found, the following strategy would be considered: 
	If the number of missing Ship Date values was minimal, they might be imputed based on the average shipping time for similar orders.
	If a significant number of Ship Date values were missing, a separate category like "Ship Date Unknown" might be created.
Other Missing Values: Other categorical columns were checked for missing values. Depending on the nature of the missing data and its impact on the analysis, the following strategies were used: 
	Imputation with the mode (most frequent value).
	Creation of a "Missing" category.
	Exclusion of rows with missing values (if they were few and would not significantly impact the analysis).
DATA TRANSFORMATIONS
Date Feature Extraction: From the Order Date and Ship Date columns, the following features were extracted: 
	Year, Month, and Day components.
	Day of the week.
	Time difference between Order Date and Ship Date (shipping time).
Geographic Aggregation: The State, and Region columns were used to create aggregated geographic features, such as: 
	Sales by region.
	Sales by state.
Categorical Aggregation: The Product Category column was used to create aggregated product features, such as: 
	Sales by product category.
	Percentage of orders per product category.
TOOLS USED
•	Microsoft Excel was used for initial data exploration, cleaning, and basic transformations.
